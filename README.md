# Day Scheduler
## The Repository
This repository ("`05-third-party-apis`") is where my Day Scheduler app resides [Day Scheduler](https://shiv-ms.github.io/05-third-party-apis/).  

<!-- The quiz requires the user to complete the 5 question quiz in 60 seconds. The user will gain 100 points for each correct answer, and lose 10 seconds for each incorect answer.  The user will then be able to save their score.
### The user is given these rules to follow, which are the same rules used to define the logic of the app
* When you click the start button then a timer starts and you are presented with a question.
* When you answer a question then you are presented with another question.
* When you answer a question incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock.
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over.
* When the game is over you can save your initial score.
